    <h1>The main requirements of a library system include:</h1>

    <pre>
    1. User management and authentication.
    2. Catalog management for books with search functionality.
    3. Check-out and check-in of books.
    4. Reservation system for unavailable books.
    5. Fine management for overdue items.
    6. Reporting and analytics for administrative purposes.</pre>

    <h1>For a library system, considering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, the basic functionalities
        should include: </h1>

    <pre>
   1. Create (C):
    - Add Book: Allow librarians to add new books to the library system, including details such as title,
    author, ISBN, genre, etc.

    2. Read (R):
    - View Book List: Provide users with the ability to view a list of available books, along with their
    details.
    - Search Books: Allow users to search for books based on criteria such as title, author, or genre.
    - View Book Details: Provide detailed information about a specific book, including its availability status.

    3. Update (U):
    - Update Book Information: Allow librarians to modify book details, such as title, author, or availability
    status.
    - Mark Book as Borrowed/Returned:Update the availability status of a book when it is borrowed or returned.

    4. Delete (D):
    - Remove Book: Allow librarians to remove a book from the library system, updating the catalog accordingly.

    These functionalities form the core operations required for managing the library's inventory and providing users
    with the ability to interact with the system effectively. Implementing CRUD operations ensures that the library
    system can handle the complete lifecycle of library resources.In the entity-relationship model for a library system, we can identify several key entities and their relationships. Here is a basic representation:

    ### Entities:
    
    1. Book:
       - Attributes:
         - BookID (Primary Key)
         - Title
         - Author
         - ISBN
         - Genre
         - AvailabilityStatus (e.g., boolean to indicate whether the book is available for borrowing)
    
    2. User:
       - Attributes:
         - UserID (Primary Key)
         - FirstName
         - LastName
         - Email
         - PhoneNumber
    
    3. Loan:
       - Attributes:
         - LoanID (Primary Key)
         - BookID (Foreign Key referencing Book)
         - UserID (Foreign Key referencing User)
         - BorrowDate
         - ReturnDate
    
    ### Relationships:
    
    1. User borrows Book (One-to-Many):
       - A user can borrow multiple books.
       - A book can be borrowed by multiple users.
    
    2. Loan associates User and Book (Many-to-One):
       - A loan is associated with one user (borrower).
       - A loan is associated with one book.

    ```plaintext
    +---------------------+        +-----------------------+        +----------------+
    |        Book         |        |          User         |        |      Loan      |
    +---------------------+        +-----------------------+        +----------------+
    | BookID (PK)         |        | UserID (PK)           |        | LoanID (PK)    |
    | Title               |        | FirstName             |        | BookID (FK)    |
    | Author              |        | LastName              |        | UserID (FK)    |
    | Genre               |        | Email                 |        | BorrowDate     |
    | AvailabilityStatus  |        | PhoneNumber           |        | ReturnDate     |
    |                     |        +-----------------------+        +----------------+
    +---------------------+
    
    
    In this diagram:
    - PK:Primary Key
    - FK:Foreign Key
    
    The relationships are represented by connecting lines between entities. Each relationship line indicates the type of relationship (One-to-Many, Many-to-One). For example, the "User borrows Book" relationship is represented by the connection between the User and Book entities.
    
    Attributes provide more details about each entity. For instance, a Book entity has attributes like Title, Author, ISBN, etc. The relationships and attributes help define the structure of the database and how different entities are related in the library system.</pre>
